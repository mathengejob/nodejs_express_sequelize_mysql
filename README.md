#**Node.js Rest CRUD API overview**
>This a complete Rest Apis that can create, retrieve, update, delete and find Payloads by title.

>First, we start with an Express web server. 
>Next, we add configuration for MySQL database, create Payload model with Sequelize, write the controller. 
>Then we define routes for handling all CRUD operations (including custom finder).

>The following table shows overview of the Rest APIs that will be exported:

|Methods	    |Urls	                |Actions                                    |
|---------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
|GET	        |api/payloads	        |get all Payloads                           |
|GET	        |api/payloads/:id	    |get Payload by id                          |
|POST	        |api/payloads	        |add new Payload                            |
|PUT	        |api/payloads/:id	    |update Payload by id                       |
|DELETE	        |api/payloads/:id	    |remove Payload by id                       |
|DELETE	        |api/payloads	        |remove all Payloads                        |
|GET	        |api/payloads/published	|find all published Payloads                |
|GET	        |api/payloads?title=[kw]|find all Payloads which title contains 'kw'|

Finally, weâ€™re gonna test the Rest Apis using Postman.

_Change db name to your preffered DB._
> Create a separate file python file to run api below for post and get 
```python
import requests
headers = {}
url = "http://localhost:8080/api/payloads"

payload_ = {"Header":"ruyryur",
"HL7":"yghklj"
}

#response = requests.post(url=url, data=payload)
response_post = requests.post(url=url, json=payload_)
response_request = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers)
print("post:", response_post.text)
#print("request:",response_request.text)
```
